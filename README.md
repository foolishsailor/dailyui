# Another compendium of #DailyUI projects

I'm not a designer so I put these together to help refine my design skills and to develop a toolbox of efficient and repeatable solutions to the same problems that appear again and again in design.

All pages are fully responsive
Each page has a fully custom theme including fonts
Here is a nifty little hook I wrote to keep bloat down by stripping out fonts before loading new ones.
